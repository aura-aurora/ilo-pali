# ilo pali
An operating system for RISC V, featuring a small microkernel.

## Build instructions
Install [the Newlib GNU RISC-V toolchain](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain#installation-newlib) and do `make` to build. Do `make run` to run. It should print out a bunch of debug information related to OpenSBI and then a single `a`.

Alternatively, you can install Clang and use `make CC=clang`.

## Exiting QEMU
This is the new "how to exit Vi" I guess. To exit, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>a</kbd>, unpress those keys, and then press <kbd>x</kbd>.

## Debugging
Execute `make gdb` and then `make run`.

If you'd like to trace the execution since the beginning, use `make run WAIT_GDB=1`. This halts the emulator until a gdb connection is established.

## Features
ilo pali microkernel features:
 - fdt driver
 - uart driver
 - initrd driver (read only)
 - memory management
 - process management
 - syscalls:
    - `alloc_page(void* addr, size_t count, int permissions) -> void* addr`
        Allocates `count` pages of memory containing addr. If addr is NULL, then it allocates the next available page. Returns NULL on failure. Write and execute cannot both be set at the same time.

    - `dealloc_page(void* addr, size_t count) -> int status`
        Deallocates the page(s) containing the given address. Returns 0 on success and 1 if a page was never allocated by this process.

    - `page_permissions(void* addr, int permissions) -> int status`
        Modifies the permissions of the given page. Returns 0 on success, 1 if the page was never allocated, and 2 if both write and execute were attempted to be set.

        Permissions:
        READ    - 0b100
        WRITE   - 0b010
        EXECUTE - 0b001

    - `spawn(void* exe, size_t exe_size, void** deps, size_t dep_sizes, size_t dep_count, void* args, size_t args_size) -> pid_t child`
        Spans a process with the given executable binary and dependencies. Returns a pid of -1 on failure.

        The executable may be a valid elf file, as can the dependencies. All data will be copied over to a new set of pages.

    - `kill(pid_t pid) -> int status`
        Kills the given process. Returns 0 on success, 1 if the process does not exist, and 2 if insufficient permissions.

    - `send(pid_t pid, int type, uint64_t data, uint64_t metadata) -> int status`
        Sends data to the given process. Returns 0 on success, 1 if process does not exist, and 2 if invalid arguments.

        Types:
        SIGNAL  - 0
            Metadata can be any integer argument for the signal (for example, the size of the requested data).
        INT     - 1
            Metadata can be set to send a 128 bit integer.
        POINTER - 2
            Metadata contains the size of the pointer. The kernel will share the pages necessary between processes.

    - `set_recv_handler(int (*handler)(pid_t source, int type, uint64_t data, uint64_t metadata)) -> int status`
        Sets the process's receive handler. Returns 0 on success, and 1 if the address is not in an allocated executable page. The receive handler may not interrupt interrupt handlers, but may interrupt all other process code.

    - `uart_write(size_t size, void* data) -> int status`
        Writes data to the UART port. Returns 0 on success, and 1 on failure.

    - `interrupt_claim(uint64_t id, int (*handler)(uint64_t id)) -> int status`
        Claims an interrupt to be handled by the given function by the current process. Returns 0 on success and 1 if interrupt was already claimed. The interrupt handler may interrupt any process code, including receive handlers.

    - `interrupt_unclaim(uint64_t id) -> int status`
        Unclaims an interrupt handled by the process. Returns 0 on success, 1 if the interrupt was already unclaimed, and 2 if the process does not claim the interrupt.

    - `spawn_thread(void (*func)(void*),Â void* data) -> pid_t thread`
        Spawns a thread (a process sharing the same memory as the current process) that executes the given function. Returns -1 on failure.

    - `lock(void* ref, int type, uint64_t value) -> int status`
        Locks the current process until the given condition is true. Returns 0 on success and 1 on invalid arguments, and 2 on unknown error.

        Types:
        WAIT    - 0
            Waits while the pointer provided is the same as value.
        WAKE    - 1
            Wakes when the pointer provided is the same as value.

    - `getpid() -> pid_t`
        Gets the pid of the current process.

    - `getppid() -> pid_t`
        Gets the pid of the parent process of the current process. Returns -1 if the parent process does not exist or died.

    - `sleep(size_t seconds, size_t nanos) -> int status`
        Sleeps for the given amount of time. Returns 0 on success and 1 on failure. Does not interrupt receive handlers or interrupt handlers. If the sleep time passed in is 0, then the syscall returns immediately.
